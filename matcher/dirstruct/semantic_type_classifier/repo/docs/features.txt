 FEATURES DOCUMENTATION
========================
Below are the description of features used by our classifier.  
Note that features are extracted from a column's name and values.
Thus, all the data from a single column is reduced to some feature
vector of the concatenation of values computed by the extractors below.

We refer to a single value from the column as an entry.
E.g.
    Person  Age  Gender
    John    20    M
    Jane    30    F
From the table above, John is an entry of the column Person.

## The following feature extractors produce a scalar value:

num-unique-vals      : A simple count of unique entries of a column
prop-unique-vals     : The proportion of unique entries of a column. 
prop-missing-vals    : The proportion of all missing/empty entries from all entries in a column.
ratio-alpha-chars    : The average of the proportion of alphabetic characters from each entry.
prop-numerical-chars : The average of the proportion of numeric characters from each entry.
prop-whitespace-chars       : The average of the proportion of whitespace characters from each entry.
prop-entries-with-at-sign   : The proportion of entries with an '@' sign.
prop-entries-with-hyphen    : The proportion of entries with a '-'.
prop-range-format           : The proportion of entries which follow some numerical range format: ([0-9]+)-([0-9]+).
is-discrete                 : A binary indicator if the column entires are discrete.
entropy-for-discrete-values : The entropy of the entries of a column.
shannon-entropy             : Shannon's entropy for the vocabulary specified in the
                              description of the feature 'char-dist-features'

## The following feature extractors produce a vector value.
Some of these are computed together to reduce computation time.
Others are values that are computed for all classes.

inferred-data-type      : Produces a vector which contains the inferred data type.  
                          Only a single element is non-zero in the vector (i.e. 1-of-K format).  
                          The set of inferret types are in {float,integer,long,boolean,date,time,datetime,string}.
                          Optional Parameters:
                              type-map:  Contains a csv that maps attribute ID to one of the types mentioned above.
                                         This allows us to interface with external data type inferrers.

char-dist-features      : produces a vector for character distribution of column values;
                        considered characters are:
                        0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~ \t\n\r\x0b\x0c

stats-of-text-length    : Computes the mean, median, mode, min, max of string lengths from a columns entries.

stats-of-numerical-type : Computes the mean, median, mode, min, max of entries from a column of numerical type.

prop-instances-per-class-in-knearestneighbours         : This finds the k columns from the training set with most similar names.
                                                         It then produces a vector of class proportions from these k neighbours.
                                                         Parameters:

                                                         cosine similarity of t with training instances of each class.
