Velasquez has co-hosted a morning radio show since late 2010.\n\nVelasquez was born in Houston, Texas. She is of Mexican, Spanish, French, Scottish, and Arab ancestry. At the age of nine, she began traveling with her father, who by that time was a full-time singing evangelist. She began by singing backup to her parents, then later sang solo. It was while on the road that she was discovered by a representative of Myrrh Records.\n\nVelasquez released her national debut album Heavenly Place in 1996 and five of the songs on that CD became No. 1 hits (she had two previous independent records). The album was later certified Platinum. Velasquez has been distinguished as the fastest selling solo debut recording artist in her genre and the first solo artist in Christian music history to reach gold status with a debut album, prior to release of sophomore project. She has since released six English-language albums, two of which were certified Gold. She has produced sixteen No. 1 Christian radio hits and six other top-10 singles, and has won seven Dove awards, including New Artist of the Year and two Female Vocalist of the Year wins. Jaci has covered over 50 magazines as well as been a spokes-model for Pepsi, Target, Doritos, John Freida's Frizz-Ease hair products and Helzberg Diamonds.\n\nIn 1999, she signed to Sony Discos and was introduced to Rudy P\u00e9rez, who produced her first Spanish-language crossover album Llegar a Ti. After that, Velasquez was able to achieve the crossover appeal she desired, building a fan base among Hispanics as well as other Americans. Her first single, \"Llegar a Ti\", topped the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks and became the first Christian song to top the chart. The song also gave her a Latin Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Female Vocal Performance (which ultimately went to Colombian singer Shakira).\n\nIn 2001, she released her second Spanish effort: Mi Coraz\u00f3n. The album's lead single, \"Como Se Cura Una Herida,\" topped the Billboard Hot Latin Tracks, and became one of the biggest singles of the year, receiving multiple award nominations and wins. The album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Latin Pop Album.\n\nHer Latin music success includes four Spanish-language releases, three No. 1 Latin Billboard Singles, two Platinum albums, a Premio Lo Nuestro Award for New Artist of the Year, two Billboard Latin Music Awards, and three Dove Awards for Spanish Language Album of the Year.\n\nVelasquez was given a chance in 2002 to act in her first Hollywood movie, Chasing Papi. As well as Velasquez, this movie featured Colombia's Sofia Vergara, Puerto Rico's Roselyn Sanchez, and Mexico's Eduardo Verastegui, as well as Nicole Scherzinger in a cameo role. It was released nationwide in the United States in April 2003. The movie reached as high as No. 11 at the box office, and it grossed $6 million in total. Velasquez has appeared in over 50 magazines\u2014including the December 2003 issue of Right On!, wherein editor Cynthia Horner calls her a true role model to teens\u2014and has sung for President George W. Bush multiple times.\n\nOn September 2008, Velasquez was chosen by the State Department's Bureau of International Information Programs as one of the 15 Prominent Hispanic-Americans in the Arts in America.\nIn June 2010 she also started working on and recording her first Spanish project since 2003 with Juan Carlos Rodriguez, from the Christian Latin pop duo Tercer Cielo, as well as writing a new book.

Her voice has been described as rich, deep, dark, mournful and unique.\n \nShe also has the ability to extend upwards into the dramatic mezzo-soprano range, examples of such would be on the songs The Host of Seraphim, Elegy, Space Weaver, Come This Way and One Perfect Sunrise. Gerrard however performs more predominantly in the dramatic contralto range in her other songs, Sanvean, Sacrifice, Largo and Not Yet.\n \nGerrard sings many of her songs, such as Now We Are Free, Come Tenderness, Serenity, The Valley of the Moon, Tempest, Pilgrimage of Lost Children, Coming Home and Sanvean in an idioglossia (an idiosyncratic language) that she has developed since the age of twelve.\n\nSince her career began in 1981, she has been involved in a wide range of projects. Gerrard received a Golden Globe Award for the music score to the film Gladiator, on which she collaborated with Hans Zimmer. In addition to singing, she is an instrumentalist for much of her work, most prolifically using the yangqin (a Chinese hammered dulcimer).  Born 12 April 1961 in Melbourne, Lisa Gerrard grew up in the suburb of Prahran with her Irish immigrant parents. On her upbringing, she has said she grew up with \"Mediterranean music blaring out of the houses,\" and that this influenced her music, particularly on later Dead Can Dance albums and in her solo and collaborative works.\n\nGerrard's first foray into forming bands and creative music-making was the highly experimental Little Band scene. It was at one of these little band events that she first met Dead Can Dance cofounder Brendan Perry. Perry recalls, \"It never occurred to me that we would one day collaborate musically together because at the time I thought her music was too avant garde. I particularly remember one song that she sang about finding a man in the park and asking her mother if she could bring him home to keep in her wardrobe as she attacked this chinese dulcimer with two bamboo sticks.\" \n\nLisa Gerrard's first experience in composing music for a film came with the 1989 Spanish film El Ni\u00f1o de la Luna, directed by Agust\u00edn Villaronga. The film score was composed by Dead Can Dance and the film featured Lisa Gerrard in her first acting role. El Ni\u00f1o de la Luna describes the story of David, a young orphan with special powers, escaping an institution with the help of a fellow institute inmate, Georgina, played by Lisa Gerrard.\n\nGerrard participated in a number of musical scores but came to fame as a film composer after recording The Insider in 1999, with Pieter Bourke, and Gladiator in 2000, with Hans Zimmer, which received an Academy Award nomination for best music score, although only Zimmer was nominated. It did, however, win a Golden Globe Award for both composers. Gerrard's score for the New Zealand independent film Whale Rider consisted entirely of solo material; a soundtrack album was released by 4AD.\n\nIn 2005 Gerrard collaborated with Ennio Morricone for Fateless followed by a collaboration with Jeff Rona on the score for the feature film \"A Thousand Roads\" and the song On an Ocean for the Henry Poole Is Here score. Gerrard along with Dead Can Dance also provided several contributions to the soundtrack of Baraka, a visual journey showcasing mankind's impact on our planet. Gerrard was also invited by Denez Prigent to collaborate with him on his piece \"Gortoz a ran - J'attends\" (meaning \"I await\"), a piece that was later used in the soundtrack of Ridley Scott's film Black Hawk Down.\n\nIn 2009 Lisa Gerrard wrote the score for Balibo, for which she won a Best Feature Film Score award at the 2009 APRA Screen Music Awards and an Aria Award for Best Original Soundtrack/Cast/Show Album at the 2009 Aria Awards.

progressive rock group. Claudio Sanchez, a drummer and another guitarist formed from a trio called Shab\u0171tie (Shab\u0171tie is from African tribal dances meaning naked prey) in 1997, but changed their name and rotated in Josh Eppard and Mic Todd in 2000. To date, they have released 4 studio albums: The Second Stage Turbine Blade (2002), In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3 (2003), Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness (2005) and Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV, Volume Two: No World for Tomorrow (2007). In the summer of 2006, Todd and Eppard officially left the band. Todd rejoined in April of 2007, just in time to record the next album, which was released on October 23, 2007. Sanchez also writes all of the band's lyrics and most of their primary song riffs, as well as The Amory Wars comic series, which recounts the science fiction story of Coheed and Cambria in further detail. He is noted for his high vocal range, often extending into an alto register in the manner of Geddy Lee, the unique enunciation of his vocals, and for his long hair with tightly-wound curls. While primarily playing rhythm during his vocals, Sanchez also plays lead, often alternating with guitarist Travis Stever in a competitive, yet respectful guitar solo fashion.He is of Puerto Rican heritage, and is one of 4 children (sisters Maria and Josephine and brother Matthew). In early 2006, Coheed and Cambria was forced to cancel several European tour dates after Sanchez broke his hand while sparring with younger brother Matthew, a professional boxer(hence Claudio's brother in the Amory Wars, along with his sister Maria), due to this he is often seen sporting a form of wrist support. Sanchez apparently suffers from acid reflux; in early 2003, he would complain that his throat was hurting on stage after singing in his upper range. Sanchez is reportedly a movie fanatic, and watches at least 2 movies a day while touring. Sanchez is engaged to his longtime girlfriend Chondra Echert as of March 2008. Sanchez is in a side project called The Prize Fighter Inferno. Their first album, My Brother's Blood Machine, was released October 31, 2006. Claudio claims When we were called Shab\u0171tie, the initial idea for Coheed and Cambria was to be an acoustic/electronic side project. So I guess The Prize Fighter Inferno is kind of the original idea for Coheed and Cambria,. Sanchez also appears on his bandmate Travis' side project dubbed Fire Deuce (backing vocals) which released Children of the Deuce in 2005, an 80s style rock album reminiscent of Iron Maiden - hence the album's title.According to an interview with former Coheed and Cambria drummer Josh Eppard in Alternative Press, Claudio has a hip hop side project that no one will ever hear.In a recent interview with The Lantern, Sanchez mentioned a new project entitled Spencer Doll and mentioned there were several others that the public did not know about, but did not elaborate any further about any of them.", "type": "/type/text"}, {"lang": "/lang/en", "value": "Claudio Sanchez is the author of The Amory Wars: Ultimate Edition.", "type": "/type/text"}], "/people/person/age": null, "/people/person/height_meters": null, "type": "/music/artist", "/people/person/place_of_birth": [{"id": "/en/nyack", "name": "Nyack"}], "name": "Claudio Sanchez", "mid": [{"value": ["/m/032rrv", "/m/03f3tgm", "/m/0827sl", "/m/0fp_bpz", "/m/0jz0txq"], "type": "/type/id"}], "/people/person/gender": [{"name": "Male"}], "/people/person/date_of_birth": [{"value": "1978-03-12", "type": "/type/datetime"}], "/music/artist/origin": [{"id": "/en/valley_cottage", "name": "Valley Cottage"}]}, {"id": [{"value": "/en/don_byron", "type": "/type/id"}], "/music/artist/active_end": [], "/people/person/nationality": [{"id": "/en/united_states", "name": "United States of America"}], "/people/person/profession": [{"name": "Clarinetist"}, {"name": "Film Score Composer"}, {"name": "Musician"}, {"name": "Multi-instrumentalist"}, {"name": "Composer"}], "/music/artist/active_start": [], "/common/topic/description": [{"lang": "/lang/en", "value": "Don Byron is a Composer.", "type": "/type/text"}], "/people/person/age": null, "/people/person/height_meters": null, "type": "/music/artist", "/people/person/place_of_birth": [{"id": "/en/the_bronx", "name": "The Bronx"}], "name": "Don Byron", "mid": [{"value": ["/m/036v89", "/m/0h4ybzm"], "type": "/type/id"}], "/people/person/gender": [{"name": "Male"}], "/people/person/date_of_birth": [{"value": "1958-11-08", "type": "/type/datetime"}], "/music/artist/origin": [{"id": "/en/new_york", "name": "New York City"}]}, {"id": [{"value": "/en/lee_gaze", "type": "/type/id"}], "/music/artist/active_end": [], "/people/person/nationality": [{"id": "/en/united_kingdom", "name": "United Kingdom"}], "/people/person/profession": [{"name": "Musician"}], "/music/artist/active_start": [], "/common/topic/description": [{"lang": "/lang/en", "value": "Lee Gaze is a musician.", "type": "/type/text"}], "/people/person/age": null, "/people/person/height_meters": null, "type": "/music/artist", "/people/person/place_of_birth": [{"id": "/en/wales", "name": "Wales"}], "name": "Lee Gaze", "mid": [{"value": ["/m/03fz36"], "type": "/type/id"}], "/people/person/gender": [{"name": "Male"}], "/people/person/date_of_birth": [{"value": "1983-05-21", "type": "/type/datetime"}], "/music/artist/origin": [{"id": "/en/pontypridd", "name": "Pontypridd"}]}, {"id": [{"value": "/en/richard_kruspe-bernstein", "type": "/type/id"}], "/music/artist/active_end": [], "/people/person/nationality": [{"id": "/en/germany", "name": "Germany"}], "/people/person/profession": [{"name": "Guitarist"}, {"name": "Musician"}, {"name": "Singer"}], "/music/artist/active_start": [{"value": "1991", "type": "/type/datetime"}], "/common/topic/description": [{"lang": "/lang/en", "value": "Richard Zven Kruspe (born 24 June 1967) Wittenberge East Germany .. he is a German musician and the lead guitarist of the German industrial metal band RAMMSTEIN, as well as the leader of the band EMIGRATE.

Her first break came in 1960 by appearing on Vere John's Opportunity Hour - and being repeatedly invited back. In the early 60's Hortense toured Jamaica with Byron Lee and The Dragonaires while honing her skills in the studio with producers such as Ken Lack and Clement \"Coxsone\" Dodd. Around this time she was also recording duets with male artists such as Derrick Morgan and her brother Alton Ellis. Her best known Coxsone sides include \"Sitting In The Park\", \"Secretly\", \"Cry Together\", \"Willow Tree\" and \"Why Birds Fly\". Hortense went on to record with other producers including Augustus Clarke and Dudley \"Manzie\" Swaby and also, for a brief spell, recorded under the name Mahalia Saunders (a combination of her own middle name and her married name). Hortense also cut one side under the name Dawn Love. Aside from recording original Jamaican songs, Hortense also covered soul classics such as \"Down The Aisle\" (Patti Labelle), \"Young Hearts Run Free\" (Candy Staton) and \"Loving Arms\" but also recorded her own beautiful versions of Elvis Presley hits \"Wooden Heart\" and \"Suspicious Minds\". One of Hortense's best known hits was \"Unexpected Places\" dating from 1978 and produced by Gussie Clarke. Also in the mid/late 70's she joined Johnny Clarke in the making of an R  B ballad style album marketed under the title \"Sly  Robbie Present Lovers Rock\" which also featured solo performances from Pat Kelly. Meanwhile Hortense's old Coxsone hit \"Sitting In The Park\" was re-recorded for producer Martin Williams while \"Secretly\" was re-recorded for Dudley \"Manzie\" Swaby. During the 1990's Hortense began suffering ill health which affected her live performances but she remained active in the studio. She became seriously ill while in Miami in the summer of 1999 and should have sought immediate treatment. Instead, she insisted on struggling home to her beloved Jamaica where she was immediately hospitalized.
