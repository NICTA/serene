He is a Canadian country singer and grew up in Fox Brook, Pictou County, Nova Scotia.  He later lived in Hopewell, Nova Scotia and currently lives in High River, Alberta.\n\n\nFamily being his first priority, Canyon, a man of Faith, abandoned his musical aspirations years ago to work as a bylaw officer in order to support his family. His wife, Jennifer, urged him to keep writing songs and performing however George felt that it was no longer practical, and put music on the back burner.\n\n In 2004, Jennifer persuaded him to audition for U.S.A Network\u2019s \"Nashville Star\"- an internationally televised performance competition similar to the \"American Idol\" format.  Canyon showed up, wowed the worldwide audiences and nearly won the entire contest. The rest is history punctuated by industry accolades, achievements and sustained success.\n\nHis integrity and dedication to his family lives as a theme through the songs he writes and the stories he tells with his music and the way he lives his life. It is also the same force that drives him to inspire youth through his role as a national spokesperson for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF). \n\n Diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age 14, Canyon was informed that he would have to forgo his ambitions and dreams to serve his country as a pilot in the Canadian Air Force. Years later he would learn to manage his disease through diet, lifestyle and the effective use of insulin pump technology. In 2009, Canyon passed a series of medical tests and as a result of this was able to obtain his pilot's license.\n\n On February 21, 2008 he was recognized for all his philanthropic work in support of the Canadian troops and was appointed Honorary Colonel for the Canadian Air Force at 14 Wing Greenwood in Nova Scotia.\n\n He never could have predicted the journey, but he finally realized the dream that had evaded him as a young man of serving in the Air Force. Later that year, Canyon took his personal story and his own plane across Canada and organized several talks and concerts to inspire youngsters afflicted with type 1 diabetes, with his inspiring message, a project he named \u201cThe Sky\u2019s Not The Limit\u201d. He urged them to take ownership of their disease, pursue their dreams, and achieve their goals. \"Being a kid is hard enough without having a disease that limits your choices. If I can tell my story and change a life or two, that's the kind of imprint I want to leave\" Canyon says. The message has been effective, and George's story continues to resonate. \n\nIn the fall of 2010, George performed and spoke to over 20,000 people at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles at a JDRF fund-raising event. \nHis 2010 hit single \"I Believe in Angels\" has been adopted as a theme song by the JDRF in the United States and Canyon appeared on \"GOOD MORNING AMERICA\" to encourage youngsters with his story. \nThe song, \u201cI Believe in Angels\u201d received a SOCAN award in November 2011, for one of the most played songs at Canadian Country Radio in 2010.\n\nAs Canyon's charitable work continues, his achievements grow with it.  In the past two years, he has been recognized as the most played Canadian artist at Canadian country radio. He's also one of the most recognizable and requested stars on CMT (Country Music Television). His videos garner hundreds of thousands of hits on YouTube and he has won multiple Juno, East Coast Music Awards and Canadian Country Music Awards including \"Humanitarian of the Year Award\" for his philanthropic endeavors. \n\nAlso an actor Canyon has appeared on some highly rated Canadian television series\u2019 such as CBC-TV\u2019s \"Heartland\" and Showcase\u2019s \"Trailer Park Boys\" and has starred in many television programs and specials.\nHe recently starred alongside Dean Cain and Luke Schroder in a made for TV movie, \u201cA Mile In His Shoes\u201d which aired in September 2011 in the US on GMC, and in Canada on Showcase in November 2011. George will also host \u201cThe Gift Of Giving\u201d a star studded show..."}], "id": [{"value": "/en/george_canyon", "type": "/type/id"}], "/music/artist/origin": [{"name": "Pictou County", "id":

But we're not.  We change with time.\" Those are the words of a man who knows a great deal about change, transition and life in the Lord.  From the time Dr. Ron Kenoly was born on December 6, 1944, until now, a great deal has transpired.  Both the man and his ministry have evolved.  At 65, he has gone from being a military man to a Rhythm and Blues artist, then from a Sunday morning congregational hymn leader to the most popular Praise and Worship leader in the country.  \"God created the world so we would go through seasons. Each season brings about a change.\" Dr. Kenoly's life is one that has gone through many seasons, all designed by God to bring him to a place of serving the Lord and leading millions of people into His presence.\n\nAfter graduating from High School in his birthplace, Coffeyville, Kansas, Kenoly ventured out to Hollywood, California.  When plans to make it in the big city fell through, he joined the Air Force in 1965.  It was in the military that he met and married Tavita, his wife of 42 years.  It was also there that the humble beginnings of his music career were launched.  Kenoly joined the Mellow Fellows, a top 40 cover band that toured military bases. In 1968, he left the Air Force and the Mellows Fellows behind and shipped out to the City of Angels to go after his passion- music.\n\n\n\"As a child I remember seeing Sammy Davis Jr. and Nat King Cole for the first time.  I was so impressed as I watched two Black men grace a national stage.  I knew right then that was what I wanted.\" So for the next few years, Kenoly poured all of his energy into making his childhood dream a reality. He sang demos of Jimmy Web songs, like the 70's hit \"Up, Up and Away,\" for the Audio Arts label.  The label also released Kenoly's first single, \"The Glory of Your Love (Mine Eyes Have Seen).\" Success in the R arena came after he signed with A Records.  Under that label, he cranked out hits like, \"Soul Vaccination.\"\n\nAll the success was taxing on Kenoly's family.  His marriage suffered, he neglected his kids and soon the home was close to ruin.  But then God stepped in. \"My wife rededicated her life to the Lord in 1975 and began praying for our family's healing.  I could see the changes in her life and that's when the\nlights came on for me.\" Again, Kenoly had to enter into another transitional season of his life. The family stayed in LA for another year as he fulfilled R contractual agreements.  Then they moved out to Oakland, CA.  While working in a service industry position, Kenoly allowed the Lord to work on him, teaching him how to be a husband and father. While teaching music and physical education at Alameda College from 1978 to 1982, Kenoly tried unsuccessfully to get a gospel record deal. \"Then one night I sat alone in church for hours playing, singing, praying and worshipping the Lord.  I found the heart of God through worship.  From then on, the record companies ceased to matter.  The Lord met me and showed me so much that I felt I had gone beyond what any company could offer me.\"\n\nSo in 1983, Kenoly produced his custom-made album, \"You Ought to Listen to This.\"  He sold the album wherever he sang.  Soon, offers to lead praise and worship came flooding in from churches in the area.  In 1985, Pastor Dick Bernal who founded the Jubilee Christian Center in San Jose, CA, invited Kenoly to be the church's Minister of Music. Shortly after, Don Moen of Integrity Music heard about Kenoly's music. In 1991, Integrity released Kenoly's first gospel album, \"Jesus is Alive.\" \"Lift Him Up,\" \"God is Able,\" \"Sing Out,\" \"Welcome Home,\" \"High Places,\" \"Majesty\" and \"We Offer Praises\" all followed Kenoly's first surprise hit.\n\nWith all 8 albums, Kenoly sold more than 4 million copies. Two albums received gold record sale status and 3 live videos went gold.  Kenoly received 19 GMA Dove Award nominations and won 1 Dove Award for \"Welcome Home.\" \"Every season of my life has had its own..."}], "id": [{"value": "/en/ron_kenoly", "type": "/type/id"}], "/music/artist/origin": [{"name": "Coffeyville", "id": "/en/coffeyville"}], "/people/person/height_meters": null, "/people/person/nationality": [{"name": "United States of America", "id": "/en/united_states"}], "type": "/music/artist", "name": "Ron Kenoly", "/people/person/age": null, "mid": [{"value": ["/m/01m6j7j", "/m/06h_kn"], "type": "/type/id"}], "/music/artist/active_end": [], "/music/artist/active_start": [], "/people/person/gender": [{"name": "Male"}], "/people/person/profession": [{"name": "Singer-songwriter"}, {"name": "Singer"}, {"name": "Songwriter"}, {"name": "Actor"}], "/people/person/place_of_birth": [{"name": "Coffeyville", "id": "/en/coffeyville"}]}, {"/people/person/date_of_birth": [{"value": "1966-12-17", "type": "/type/datetime"}], "/common/topic/description": [{"type": "/type/text", "lang": "/lang/en", "value": "Tracy Byrd is an American music artist, singer, songwriter and businessperson."}], "id": [{"value": "/en/tracy_byrd", "type": "/type/id"}], "/music/artist/origin": [{"name": "Vidor", "id": "/en/vidor_texas"}, {"name": "Beaumont", "id": "/en/beaumont"}], "/people/person/height_meters": null, "/people/person/nationality": [{"name": "United States of America", "id": "/en/united_states"}], "type": "/music/artist", "name": "Tracy Byrd", "/people/person/age": null, "mid": [{"value": ["/m/01m840r", "/m/05spmt"], "type": "/type/id"}], "/music/artist/active_end": [], "/music/artist/active_start": [], "/people/person/gender": [{"name": "Male"}], "/people/person/profession": [{"name": "Singer-songwriter"}, {"name": "Businessperson"}, {"name": "Music artist"}, {"name": "Musician"}], "/people/person/place_of_birth": [{"name": "Vidor", "id": "/en/vidor_texas"}]}, {"/people/person/date_of_birth": [{"value": "1957-05-22", "type": "/type/datetime"}], "/common/topic/description": [{"type": "/type/text", "lang": "/lang/en", "value": "Shirley Murdock (born May 22, 1957, in Toledo, Ohio) is an American R singer, who is best known for her 1986 R hit single \"As We Lay\" and for her vocals on Zapp and Roger hit single Computer Love.
