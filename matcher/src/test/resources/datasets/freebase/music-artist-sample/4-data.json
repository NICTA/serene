bass virtuoso, multi-instrumentalist and session musician best know for his work as the bass player for Australian grunge funk band John Smith Quintet (JSQ) and funk rock trio Global Frontier.\u00a0Early years:   Chris Frangou was born 3 May 1991 in Bacchus Marsh (a small town in Victoria), Australia. He was raised in a musical family where his father played electric guitar. Whilst still very young he began playing piano and recieved lessons at school. He continued piano for a few years until he decided to start learning the bass guitar because he claimed \"...there are not enough good bass players out there and every one plays guitar\" and by late 2003 his father bought him his first bass, a black Fender Jazz Bass which he still uses today. Shortly after starting bass, Frangou began listening to music like Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin and similar rock bands. He says that while he still played piano he was influenced by ragtime players like Scott Joplin. The early rock music quickly began to show in his playing when he adopted a fat classic bass sound but it was not until he discovered bass oriented bands like Red Hot Chili Peppers and Primus that his unique bass sound began to take form.Global Frontier:In 2006 Chris Frangou formed a Ska/Jazz Fusion band containing members and friends from his highschool bands. The rhythm section consisted of Chris on electric bass, Domenic Nardo on electric guitar and Phill Rogers on drums. After playing a few gigs the trio discovered their ability to connect musically and in June 2006 they created the funk-rock band Global Frontier. Later in 2007 Global Frontier was put on hiatus after Chris Frangou left to record and tour with his new band John Smith Quintet.Sound Theory:  In late 2006 Frangou began to record solo material which he named Chris Frangou's Sound Theory. It exhibits him writing and playing all instruments heard. Not intended for full public release he kept the material under his own record label Envelope Music named after the song \"ENVELOPE\" that he wrote. He continues to write material for Sound Theory and plans for the small scale release of a Sound Theory album sometime in 2009 or 2010. He has recently hinted at the fact that it may be of the Jazz Fusion genre and that it may include his own big band.John Smith Quintet:In August 2007 Chris Frangou co-created Australian Grunk band John Smith Quintet. He is intrumented in the developement of their unique bass oriented sound and has co-wrtten many of their hit songs including 'Healing' and 'Tram'. Chris claims he thought of the name John Smith Quintet and its catch phrase \"...who is John Smith?\" thinking it would be quirky to be named a quintet without actually having 5 people and a John Smith.Sound and technique: Being professionally trained he gained experience over the years playing electric bass and upright bass for numerous jazz bands, rock groups and solo artists. He is known for his extensive use of slap bass technique and large array of effects. One example of his effects heavy sound can be heard on his signature track ENVELOPE.Equipment:Chris Frangou is known for his expert knowledge of musical gear and utilising a wide range of equipment. As of recently he is primarily using both a 2003 Fender Jazz bass and a 2008 Custom Fender Jazz Bass Fretless in the studio and on tour. He currently uses Hartke bass cabinets and heads but also utilises Ampeg 8x10's, SVT-VR's.", "type": "/type/text"}], "type": "/music/artist", "/people/person/gender": [{"name": "Male"}], "/people/person/date_of_birth": [{"value": "1991-05-03", "type": "/type/datetime"}], "/people/person/nationality": [{"id": "/en/australia", "name": "Australia"}]}, {"name": "Big Narstie", "/people/person/height_meters": null, "/music/artist/origin": [{"id": "/en/brixton", "name": "Brixton"}], "/people/person/profession": [{"name": "Actor"}, {"name": "Rapper"}, {"name": "Digital Artist"}], "/music/artist/active_end": [], "/music/artist/active_start": [], "mid": [{"value": ["/m/04fd992", "/m/0100fxbp"], "type": "/type/id"}], "/people/person/age": null, "id": [{"value": "/en/big_narstie", "type": "/type/id"}], "/people/person/place_of_birth": [{"id": "/en/lambeth", "name": "Lambeth"}], "/common/topic/description": [{"lang": "/lang/en", "value": "Big Narstie is an actor.", "type": "/type/text"}], "type": "/music/artist", "/people/person/gender": [{"name": "Male"}], "/people/person/date_of_birth": [{"value": "1985-11-16", "type": "/type/datetime"}], "/people/person/nationality": [{"id": "/en/united_kingdom", "name": "United Kingdom"}]}, {"name": "Daniel Gula", "/people/person/height_meters": 1.89, "/music/artist/origin": [{"id": "/en/belleville_illinois", "name": "Belleville"}], "/people/person/profession": [{"name": "Editor"}, {"name": "Musician"}, {"name": "Actor"}], "/music/artist/active_end": [], "/music/artist/active_start": [], "mid": [{"value": ["/m/04j4ppq"], "type": "/type/id"}], "/people/person/age": null, "id": [{"value": "/en/daniel_gula", "type": "/type/id"}], "/people/person/place_of_birth": [{"id": "/en/belleville_illinois", "name": "Belleville"}], "/common/topic/description": [{"lang": "/lang/en", "value": "Daniel Gula is a musician in the Independent Rock band Redding.

Leading groups such as the Omimah Band, the Young Kenneries, and the African Kenneries International, Owoh remained popular even as Nigerian tastes shifted to the newer juju and fuji styles. Owoh's rootsy take on highlife music led him into political realms in the turbulent Nigeria of the 1980s, and he was imprisoned for a time on drug charges. Dubbed the \"King of Toye,\" as he dubbed his particular musical mix, Owoh entered his fifth decade of performing with his powers and popularity undiminished.A member of the Yoruba ethnic group, Owoh was born Oladipupo Owomoyela in Nigeria's Oyo state. Some publications have assigned Owoh's birthdate to the early 1940s, but Nigeria's\u00a0P.M. News\u00a0(in an article reproduced by the\u00a0Africa News\u00a0online service) reported that Owoh celebrated his 70th birthday on February 14, 2002, and a 2005 report in the Nigerian\u00a0Sun\u00a0tabloid gave his age as 73. Owoh's father was a carpenter who was known around the town of Osogbo as a good part-time musician, but he greeted his son's growing interest in music with little enthusiasm.Blazed Through Carpentry ApprenticeshipThe family moved frequently from place to place, but Owoh sought out musicians and formed bands in each place they landed. Owoh's father insisted that Owoh learn a trade as a condition of being allowed to work on his music, and Owoh obediently apprenticed himself to a carpenter. \"I learned fast,\" Owoh told Tosin Ajirire of Nigeria's\u00a0Daily Sun.\u00a0\"A trade that would take my contemporaries four or eight years to learn, I mastered in only six months. So, having satisfied my father, he couldn't help but bless my choice of career.\"Owoh's first break came when he was hired as a musician by Nigeria's Kola Ogunmola Theatre Group, one of the country's first theatrical troupes. Owoh played drums and sang with the group when England's Queen Elizabeth visited Ibadan, Nigeria, in 1956, and he continued to perform plays mounted at the University of Ibadan. Performing with several bands, including one called Akindele (or Dele Jolly) and His Chocolate Dandies, and in another called the Fakunle Major Band, Owoh realized that music in West Africa was developing in a new direction, and sought out lessons on the electric guitar from musician Fatai Rolling Dollar.The hot style of the day in Nigeria and Ghana was called highlife. It developed from a traditional Yoruba genre called palm wine music, overlaid with danceable guitar rhythms, and, in the hands of many musicians, it also contained a strong element of Trinidadian calypso. In Owoh's music, however, the sophisticated Caribbean-style horn arrangements of highlife were deemphasized in favor of Owoh's guttural voice, guitar, percussion, and down-to-earth lyrics. Owoh formed his first group, Orlando Owoh and His Omimah Band, around 1960 and quickly recorded his first single, \"Oluwa, lo ran Mi\" (\"God has sent me\") on the Nigerian branch of the Decca label.Heard Record Played in StoreIt's a thrill for any musician to hear his or her record being played on the streets for the first time, but Owoh's experience was more thrilling than most. \"I almost died the first time I heard my record,\" he told Ajirire. \"I was passing along Idi Oro in Mushin and suddenly I heard my record being played in a shop across the road. ... Without looking at both sides, I dashed across the road and ran towards the shop. I heard a car screech to a halt; it almost crushed me to death.\" The enraged driver pursued Owoh into the shop, but calmed down when Owoh pointed out that he was the musician heard on the recording.Owoh notched several hits in Nigeria in the 1960s, but his career was slowed between 1967 and 1970 by the country's civil war. Owoh fought for the Nigerian government against the country's Biafran rebels. After the war he recorded a major hit called \"Oriki Ilu Oke,\" and his fame...", "type": "/type/text"}], "type": "/music/artist", "/people/person/gender": [{"name": "Male"}], "/people/person/date_of_birth": [{"value": "1932", "type": "/type/datetime"}], "/people/person/nationality": [{"id": "/en/nigeria", "name": "Nigeria"}]}, {"name": "Clint Crisher", "/people/person/height_meters": 1.88, "/music/artist/origin": [{"id": "/en/jacksonville", "name": "Jacksonville"}], "/people/person/profession": [{"name": "Actor"}, {"name": "Screenwriter"}, {"name": "Film director"}, {"name": "Music Video Director"}, {"name": "Dancer"}, {"name": "Performer"}, {"name": "Video editor"}, {"name": "Singer-songwriter"}, {"name": "Musician"}, {"name": "Film Producer"}], "/music/artist/active_end": [], "/music/artist/active_start": [{"value": "1993", "type": "/type/datetime"}], "mid": [{"value": ["/m/0644fx8", "/m/0c9qqcp", "/m/0gy1jcr", "/m/0644_0f"], "type": "/type/id"}], "/people/person/age": null, "id": [{"value": "/wikipedia/en_title/Clint_Crisher", "type": "/type/id"}], "/people/person/place_of_birth": [{"id": "/m/04841ld", "name": "Enterprise"}], "/common/topic/description": [{"lang": "/lang/en", "value": "\u00a0Clint Crisher and his catalog of over 100 songs, provides popular material for the likes of XM Satellite Radio, ABC Radio Networks and nightclubs across the country.

composer and musician whose work encompasses electronic music, experimental noise, ambient music, industrial, and black metal. Broude began experimenting with unusual sounds when he was eight years old, creating tape loops and combining them with spoken word material, but he didn't begin working with music seriously until 2005, when after a long period of emotional turmoil he fell in with a collective of musicians, artists, and squatters in Chicago. Surrounded by like-minded individuals, Broude soon formed a black metal group called Zog. Zog consisted of Broude on bass, with Chris Anderson and Eric Sepata on guitars, and Danny Cortez on drums; the band released a four-song EP, Revive, but proved short-lived when Cortez died ten months after the group was launched. \n\nIn 2006, Broude recorded an industrial-influenced single, \"Psychological Warfare\" b/w \"God Smacker,\" which earned enthusiastic reviews despite being released only as a 7\" single in a limited edition of 50 copies. Broude took a break from music in 2007 to address personal issues, but returned to performing the following year, and in 2009 he released an album-length solo project through his own NoZen Records label, Rites of Zen, a 76-minute ambient piece that crafted found sounds, electronics, and organic instruments into a gentle but sinister soundscape. Another dark ambient album, Medicine, followed the same year, and in 2010 he released Sick Spider, a collaboration with Tim Lash, as well as a split release with Sequences, Medicine/Vespertine: A Tragedy in Several Tones of Grey. In 2011, Broude reissued the \"Psychological Warfare\" single in a remixed digital edition, and an industrial/black metal influenced single, \"Cruel Society\" b/w \"The Sixth Era.\"", "type": "/type/text"}], "type": "/music/artist", "/people/person/gender": [{"name": "Male"}], "/people/person/date_of_birth": [{"value": "1984-08-23", "type": "/type/datetime"}], "/people/person/nationality": [{"id": "/en/united_states", "name": "United States of America"}]}, {"name": "Ken Lawson", "/people/person/height_meters": null, "/music/artist/origin": [{"id": "/en/los_angeles_county", "name": "Los Angeles County"}], "/people/person/profession": [{"name": "Actor"}, {"name": "Musician"}], "/music/artist/active_end": [], "/music/artist/active_start": [], "mid": [{"value": ["/m/097n98y", "/m/0kbhjmg"], "type": "/type/id"}], "/people/person/age": null, "id": [{"value": "/wikipedia/en_title/Ken_Lawson", "type": "/type/id"}], "/people/person/place_of_birth": [{"id": "/en/west_covina", "name": "West Covina"}], "/common/topic/description": [{"lang": "/lang/en", "value": "Ken Lawson is an actor and musician.", "type": "/type/text"}], "type": "/music/artist", "/people/person/gender": [{"name": "Male"}], "/people/person/date_of_birth": [{"value": "1976-01-19", "type": "/type/datetime"}], "/people/person/nationality": [{"id": "/en/united_states", "name": "United States of America"}]}, {"name": "The Tallest Man on Earth", "/people/person/height_meters": 1.7, "/music/artist/origin": [{"id": "/en/leksand", "name": "Leksand"}], "/people/person/profession": [{"name": "Singer-songwriter"}, {"name": "Singer"}, {"name": "Guitarist"}, {"name": "Film Score Composer"}], "/music/artist/active_end": [], "/music/artist/active_start": [], "mid": [{"value": ["/m/047q095", "/m/03j21pv", "/m/09s5sgv", "/m/011fd4gd"], "type": "/type/id"}], "/people/person/age": null, "id": [{"value": "/en/the_tallest_man_on_earth", "type": "/type/id"}], "/people/person/place_of_birth": [{"id": "/en/leksand", "name": "Leksand"}], "/common/topic/description": [{"lang": "/lang/en", "value": "Kristian Matsson is a film score composer.", "type": "/type/text"}], "type": "/music/artist", "/people/person/gender": [{"name": "Male"}], "/people/person/date_of_birth": [{"value": "1983-04-30", "type": "/type/datetime"}], "/people/person/nationality": [{"id": "/en/sweden", "name": "Sweden"}]}, {"name": "Aura Urziceanu Rully", "/people/person/height_meters": null, "/music/artist/origin": [{"id": "/en/carnegie_hall_with_duke_ellington_orchestra_1972", "name": "Carnegie Hall with Duke Ellington Orchestra 1972"}], "/people/person/profession": [{"name": "Jazz Artist/Singer"}], "/music/artist/active_end": [], "/music/artist/active_start": [], "mid": [{"value": ["/m/0b0fvcc"], "type": "/type/id"}], "/people/person/age": null, "id": [{"value": "/en/aura_urziceanu_rully", "type": "/type/id"}], "/people/person/place_of_birth": [{"id": "/en/bucharest", "name": "Bucharest"}], "/common/topic/description": [{"lang": "/lang/en", "value": "Singer / songwriter... recording artist \nShe brought Carnegie Hall to its feet in concert with Duke Ellington \n\nShe toured the USA and Japan with Quincy Jones. \n\nShe toured and recorded with the Thad Jones \u0026amp; Mel Lewis Orchestra.\n\nShe won accolades of superlative reviews: \n\nDownbeat Magazine, Coda Magazine, Toronto Star, \nThe New Yorker, Starweek, New York Times, \nThe Great American Popular Singers, \nThe Grove International Encyclopedia of Jazz. \n\nShe is the winner of the European Press Prize at the prestigious International Europe Cup Festival at Knocke, Belgium.\n\nShe has been invited by Duke Ellington Orchestra to sing on April 25 th.

The album \"Christopher Morris Band\" included such talent as Vince Colaiuta, the Tower of Power Horn section; Emil Richards and Milt Holland, percussionists; and the Ron Hicklin Singers.

Morris's bands have consistently provided musical exposure to emerging talent, and have included such musicians as Vince Colaiuta (named Drummer of the Year for twelve consecutive years), Tim Landers, Leslie Kuipers, Ted Lo, Gerry Etkins, all of whom subsequently achieved musical notability.

Before joining the group, he was a member of a dance team in Gwangju, South Korea. He first appeared on television on the reality television series Let\u2019s Cokeplay: M.Net Battle Shinhwa, a show in which Shinhwa attempted to create a boy band that could be a \u201csecond Shinhwa\u201d. Although he was noticed for his dance skills, his lack of vocal skills led to him being eliminated. He was later scouted by the record label YG Entertainment and joined the group BIG BANG in 2006. Although he was initially cut on the ninth episode of the group\u2019s documentary series, he was given another chance to impress YG Entertainment CEO Yang Hyun Suk and succeeded.\n\nSeungri is known for his dance skills. In his hometown, Gwangju, he was part of the dance group II Hwa. He has competed against his fellow BIG BANG member Taeyang in several dance competitions, as well as against Super Junior\u2019s Eunhyuk, tvxq\u2019s Yunho, and SHINee\u2019s Taemin. Seungri also choreographed some of Big Bang\u2019s dance.\n\nSeungri became the first member of BIG BANG to act in a musical with the performance in Sonagi in 2008. His next musical, Shouting, was performed in 2009 alongside another BIG BANG member Daesung, who was unable to perform at the last minute due to a car accident. Seungri made his film debut in with the movie Why Did You Come to My House?, followed by My 19 alongside another Big Bang member T.O.P . The movie was released on November 12, 2009. Although his first solo song Next Day was recorded as part of BIG BANG\u2019s album track, his second solo song Strong Baby was released as a promotional single for the group\u2019s second Korean album.
