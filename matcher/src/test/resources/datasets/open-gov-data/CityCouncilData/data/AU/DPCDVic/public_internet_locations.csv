We ran out of funding a long long time ago, but are supporting it with fees, etc.     Our members are mostly older people and they go home and buy their own computer or already have one and want to know how to work it.     The access is largely used by younger people with no access to the internet except at school or the library. Some just like the email, others are job hunters, we have a couple of people hunting their family trees.     It is still a worthwhile project and we will continue to supply the training and access. It would be nice to have more funding. We are fortunate to have a tutor who has good rapport with students, coming down to their level. These tutors are a treasure, and an even bigger treasure if they are happy to work for our rates of pay.     We run into problems with funding as we at Leongatha only have 3 computers, so the fees do not stretch very far. But, indeed, that is why our students come here. The small classes are non threatening and students have lots of help. "
