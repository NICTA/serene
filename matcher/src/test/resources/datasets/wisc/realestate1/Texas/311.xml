<house_description>This custom home sits on 10+ acres in the pines. You will be very impressed with the woodwork in this home. There is Redwood, White Ash, Black Walnut, Pine, Cedar Closets, solid wood cabinets in the kitchen,etc. This is truly a lovely well built home. Double pained windows, ceiling fans, etc. There is an old chandelier over the dining table that is very unique. Double roof has metal roof on top. A wood burning stove in the living area works great and it is suggested to use it only on very cold days. The deck is very large and goes all the way around the house. The two car garages is very large</house_description>
