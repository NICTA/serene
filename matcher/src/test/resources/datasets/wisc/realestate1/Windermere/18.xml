<comments>This is a realy large home on a good lot. The back yard is fenced and has lots of trees and is private. Two car garage with access into lower level of this split entry home. Home needs some fix up and the seller will give buyer $2500 to do some of the work needed. The bedrooms are all big and the home is in a good area for easy commute to either Coeru d'Alene or Post Falls. Priced right for the condition, Make offers.</comments>
