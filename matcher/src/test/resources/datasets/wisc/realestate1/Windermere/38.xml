<comments>Immaculate mobile home!  Very light and cheery inside.  Wallpapered/no paneled walls.  New vinyl window in front and hallway.  Nice Berber carpet throughout.  Kitchen &amp; dining also carpeted. Nice appliances included.  Seller is the original owner and home shows pride of ownership.



Yard is well maintained and a small garden shed is to the rear of the home.</comments>
