<comments>Beautiful custom 2-story log home on nearly 10 acres, plus a traditional wood-sided insulated barn/shop with a wood stove.  The sunny, vaulted great room features a river rock fireplace and loft area ideally suited for a home office.  The large country kitchen with custom cabinets and woodwork features a bright southern exposure overlooking beautiful terraced grounds, forest and valley vistas. The master suite has its own sitting area.  The insulated Barn has an upstairs which could easily be finished to provide additional guest sleeping quarters.</comments>
