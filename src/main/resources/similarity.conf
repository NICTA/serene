# This is a master list of comments as used in the example configuration  
# files found in this directory. This is not intended to be used as a 
# configuration file but rather as a plain text summary of possible options  
# and their values. In fact, the measures will not accept this as a  
# configuration file.
# 
# All of these options have default values that are described below. The  
# only exception to this is vectordb, which has no default. If an option is  
# listed without a value (as in trace:: or cache:: ), then the default value  
# is used. 
# 
# Note that in the configuration files anything following a # is treated as  
# a comment, so the following text can be used directly in a configuration 
# file. You will want to make sure to change the value of an option as fits 
# your needs however!

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following options are supported for all measures

trace = 0       # Turns off (0) tracing. Turn on tracing by setting
                # to 1 or 2. The effect of these different levels will
                # depend on the measure being used. The default value 
                # is off (0). If the value is omitted, then the default  
                # is used. 0, 1, and 2 are the only valid settings.

cache = 1       # Turns on (1) caching. Turn off caching by setting 
                # to 0. The default is on (1). If the value is omitted,
                # then the default is used. 0 and 1 are the only valid
                # settings.

maxCacheSize = 1000

                # Limit the cache size to 1000 pairs of query words.
                # The default is 5000.  If the value is omitted, then
                # the default is used.  The value of this option
                # must be a non-negative integer or "unlimited" (without
                # the quotes). 

mfs = 0         # Use Most Frequent Sense when (1).
                # Use all sense combinations when (0). 
                # MFS increases calculation speed up

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# In the future, the following option will be supported by:
#               path, lch, wup, res, lin, jcn
# 
# rootNode = 1    # Turns on (1) a (hypothetical) top-level root node for
#                 # the nouns, and another for the verbs. Turn off the 
#                 # root nodes by setting to 0.  The default is to use (1) 
#                 # a unique top-level root node.  If the value is omitted,
#                 # then the default is used.  0 and 1 are the only valid
#                 # settings. 
#                 # THIS VALUE IS ALWAYS 1 IN CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following option is supported by :
#               res, lin, jcn

infocontent = ic-semcor.dat

                # Specifies the name of an information content file under 
                # data/. The value of this option must be the name of a 
                # file, or a relative or absolute path name. The default 
                # value of this option ic-semcor.dat.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following options are supported by vector and lesk

stem = 0        # Turns on (1) stemming. Turn off stemming by setting
                # this value to 0. The default value is off (0).  When 
                # stemming is on (1), all the words in a gloss are stemmed 
                # by the Porter stemmer before overlaps are identified.

stoplist = stoplist.txt

                # Specifies the name of a stop list, which consists of
                # words that are to be ignored in a gloss overlap. The
                # value of this must be a file name, or an absolute or
                # relative path name. The default is to not use a stop
                # list. If the value is omitted, then the default is used.
                # The default value of this option is stoplist.txt

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The following options are supported by the lesk measure
# 
# (currently not supported)
# lesk-relation = lesk-relation.dat
# 
                   # Specifies a lesk relation file. This value can be a file 
                   # name, or an absolute or relative path name. The default 
                   # is to use the file lesk-relation.dat, 
                   # Please note that the format of the lesk relation file is not the same as 
                   # that of the vector relation file. The lesk relation file
                   # consists of relation pairs that specify glosses that  
                   # are to be compared for overlaps. 

lesk-normalize = 1 # Turns on (1) normalization of lesk scoring. Turn off
                   # by setting this value to 0. The default value is on 
                   # (1).  If the  value is omitted, then the default is used.  
                   # When normalization is enabled, the gloss overlap score 
                   # is normalized by the size of the glosses. The details 
                   # are described in Banerjee and Pedersen (2002).

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# In the future, the following option will be supported by the vector measure
# 
# vectordb = wordvectors.dat
# 
#               # Specifies a database file containing word vectors.
#               # The value of this option must be a file name, or an
#               # absolute or relative path name. utils/wordVectors.pl 
#               # must be used to generate this file. This option is
#               # required, and there is no default value. If the 
#               # option is not specified, or if the option is specified
#               # without a value, the vector measure will fail. 
# 
# vector-relation = vector-relation.dat
# 
#               # Specifies a vector relation file. This value can be a file 
#               # name, or an absolute or relative path name. The default 
#               # is to use the glos-example relation. If the value is 
#               # ommited, then the default is used. Please note that the 
#               # format of the vector relation file is not the same as 
#               # that of the lesk relation file. The vector relation file
#               # consists of single relations that specify which glossess
#               # of a word will be used in constructing the gloss vector.
# 
# compounds = wn30compounds.txt
# 
#               # Specifies a file of WordNet compounds. The value of
#               # this option must be a file name, or an absolute or 
#               # relative path. The program utils /compounds.pl can 
#               # be used to generate this file. When compounds are 
#               # specified, compound words that occur in glosses are
#               # identified prior to creating word vectors. The default 
#               # is to ignore compound words. If the value of this 
#               # option is omitted, then the default is used.  

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# In the future, the following option may be supported by the random measure
# 
# maxrand = 1   # The random measure will generate measures between 0
#               # and this value. The value of this option may be an
#               # integer or a real number. The default value is 1. 
#               # If the value of this option is omitted, then the 
#               # default is used.
