    "http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract" : [ { "type" : "literal", "value" : "Jim Owen (born April 21, 1941 in Robards, Kentucky) is an American singer-songwriter. When he was eight years old, Owen saw Hank Williams Sr sing and from that time he became completely fascinated by the star and his music. After completing his education, he worked variously as a journalist and as a golf coach until 1969 when, with Mel Tillis\u2019 help, he relocated to Nashville Tennessee to work as a songwriter.Over the next few years, several artists had chart hits with his songs. These included \u2018Too Lonely Too Long\u2019 and \u2018One More Drink\u2019 (both Mel Tillis), \u2018Little Boy\u2019s Prayer\u2019 (Porter Wagoner), \u2018Sweet Baby On My Mind\u2019 (June Stearns), \u2018Southern Loving\u2019 and \u2018Broad Minded Man\u2019 (both Jim Ed Brown), \u2018The Telephone\u2019 (Jerry Reed) and arguably the best-known of all, \u2018Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man\u2019 (Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn). He never lost his obsession with Hank Williams and encouraged by his wife, who once dreamed that she saw Owen onstage at the Grand Ole Opry but that it was Williams\u2019 voice that she heard coming from him, he began to recreate his idol as an impressionist or impersonator. He talked with people that had known or worked with Williams and practiced his mannerisms and stage presentation.In 1976, he presented \"Hank,\" a one-hour PBS television special that won him an Emmy award for the best show of the year on public television. He then produced a 90-minute one-man live stage show: \"An Evening With Hank Williams\" which had backing tracks provided by Hank\u2019s band: \"The Drifting Cowboys.\" He commenced touring extensively with the show and regularly drew audiences of thousands at countless venues.He also starred in the 1980 film: \"Hank Williams:The Man And His Music\" for which he received an Emmy nomination.In 1978, his Epic recording of \"Lovesick Blues\" recorded with the \"Drifting Cowboys\" was a minor chart hit and in the early 1980s, he scored two more minor hits with \u2018Ten Anniversary Presents\u2019 and \u2018Hell Yes, I Cheated\u2019.In 1985, he wrote and produced a 10-hour Hank Williams radio show which, on New Year\u2019s Day was broadcast on various U.S. stations as a tribute. Owen has also appeared as Williams for the noted \"Legends In Concert\" at the Imperial Palace, Las Vegas, Nevada and made many appearances on the Grand Ole Opry, including a special one on January 1, 1993, the 40th anniversary of Williams\u2019 death, which gained him a standing ovation. He continued to tour into the 1990s, still writes songs and, at times, works as an auctioneer near his Henderson, Tennessee home. He is also noted for his collection of classic cars.Legendary singer and songwriter Jim Owen mentioned at Music of Missouri has been entertaining audiences with his comedy and award winning musical talent for years in Branson, Missouri. He performs many of the songs he has written for numerous country music stars which have become classics. You will be amazed at how many of your country favorites were written by this talented songwriter. Owen won an Emmy Award for his portrayal of Hank Williams Sr. in a made for TV movie that he both wrote and starred in. His show is complete with clips and songs of Hank as well as other legendary artists.Charlie Daniels once called Jim Owen country music's least known country superstar, and that might be true in some cases but he is certainly well known by true country music fans all over the world.In 2012, Owen had only 45 shows scheduled although most years he tops 150.Performances in Branson were curtailed following the 2012 Leap Day tornado outbreak.Not to be confused with Jim Owen who served 12 years as Mayor of Branson." , "lang" : "en" } ] ,
