<house_description>Quaint old home just a block and a half from the historic Glen Rose Square.  The age of the house is unknown, but it probably dates back 70 + years.  The house still has the original wooden floors, walls, ceilings, etc.  The current zoning puts the house in the commercial district, but because it is still being occupied as a home, it could be restored as a residence, or it would make a great location for a small business.</house_description>
