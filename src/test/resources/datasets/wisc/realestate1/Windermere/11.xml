<comments>This elegant European-style contemporary home is just 3 miles from town on a very private 4.67 acres.  A gated entrance, lavish stucco exterior and tile roof, high ceilings, gourmet kitchen and beautiful courtyard patio are just a few of the quality features of this extraordinary North Idaho home. Furniture package also available.</comments>
