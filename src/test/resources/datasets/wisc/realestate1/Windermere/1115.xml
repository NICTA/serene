<comments>Scenic views abound. These acreage's are in such demand and difficult to find. This 20 acre, irrigated acreage is located in a gorgeous setting with views of Smith Rock and The Lone Pine Valley. This 2 bedroom, 1 bath home is older but has a lot of life yet.Some outbuildings and corrals and a great well. $219,900</comments>
