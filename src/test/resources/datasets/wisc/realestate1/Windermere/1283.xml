<comments>First time buyer?  Investor in rental properties?  Really cute home in heart of Parkrose residential district.  New W/W carpet over hardwood floors.  Many updates, but still needs some TLC to really shine!  Large bright kitchen, useable attic storage, new roof 2 years ago.  Sewer assessment will be paid at closing.  Seller may do 1031 exchange at no cost to buyer.  Huge lot for play area, addition, or ???  Don't delay!  This one is priced to sell!  Call JOE SANTRY at 661-5200 for more info.</comments>
