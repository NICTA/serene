<comments>This 1930 home was the victim of an electrical fire and terrible water damage in 1998.  As a result, the insurance company has rebuilt this home from the inside out.  All plumbing, electrical, insulation and on and on is new.  This home has not been lived in since the fire and everything is brand new, including the appliances.  For more information, contact Debra Hall at 208-788-1700 or e-mail her at debrahall@sunvalley.net</comments>
