<comments>Excellent investment for those going to college or those wanted a mother-in-law apt. Live in either the upper 3 bdrm, 2 bath or the lower 2 bdrm, 1 bath and rent one for added income.  Both have separate utilities, fireplaces, shared garage.  Exterior recently repainted and units have been updated within last couple years.  































































































one unit and rent the other to help with your payments.  Each unit has its own fireplace &amp; utility area.  Lovely fenced yard and there is even an attached 2 car garage.  What more could you want?!  Invest in your future today and give us a call.</comments>
